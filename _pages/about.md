I am head of Data Science at ITE Management, an alternative asset hedge fund and private equity firm. 
I've held engineering and research scientist roles in industry since 2014.


My academic training is in mathematics, computer science (undergraduate) and statistics (PhD).
My most recent research work has focused on Bayesian inference techniques for factor analysis and sequential models.
