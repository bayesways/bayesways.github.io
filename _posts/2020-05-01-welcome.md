The plan for this group is to discuss scientific ideas and theories (old and new) that match the interests of the group. I imagine it will work a bit like a reading club where everyone reads the assigned reading ahead of the discussion. Below I will maintain a running list of potential topics to come:

* 5/16/20 [Stephen Wolfram's new physics](/post/stephen-wolfram-s-new-physics/)
* 5/30/20 [MW Algorithm & Evolution Theory](/post/evolution-theory-and-complexity/)
* Physics of Vacuum
* Theo's intro to Biology
* Godel's Incompleteness Theorems
* Random matrix theory
* Climate Theory
* Bayesian cognition theory 
* Kevin Buzzards new proof language system 
* Functional programming (take a look at [this website](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) for an idea)
* Simulated Annealing Algorithm
