Welcome to the new 2023 session of math club

We are thinking of structuring it as a monthly reading club.
Leaning towards shorter topics (spanning no more than 3 meetings) and using a topic leader to guide the group. We could also invite topic experts to explain their area of knowledge.


# Ada Boost topic
Overview of gradient descent
[An Introduction to  the Conjugate Gradient Method Without the Agonizing Pain](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjG3pb8pr78AhW9FmIAHUcVDycQFnoECA4QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs.cmu.edu%2F~quake-papers%2Fpainless-conjugate-gradient.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2Nuy9Torzq92zsmJPFpZ1r)


# State Space Models 
An introduction to Sequential Monte Carlo book
