This is a post for mostly personal use (more than my personal average :) ). 
Having to set up a new laptop is one of those events that fall in the optimal postponing zone. Happens regularly to annoy you but infrequently to justify solving it systematically. So you only remember it when it happens and you put off solving it for another few years because "why spend extra time on it now?".


I just got a new laptop so I am going to document the steps it takes me to set it up.
