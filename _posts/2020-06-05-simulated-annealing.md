Simulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function.

It's a very interesting approach that is also very effective. Within a given budget, it usually provides the best answer. For example to the traveling salesman problem. 

This talk by Matthew Richey has a great explanation and visualization of the method in the context of the ising model [video](https://youtu.be/uVAbjxLUnzM?t=2733)
